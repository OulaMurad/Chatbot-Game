Hi,
My name is Oula Murad!

A chatbot written in es6 and vs6 for twilio and testing on the web. The important files are index.js and game.js.

I  made  My own adventure to create my game . 
It's a game of 2 players
the computer is one of 2 player and he will ask questions and count the correct answers for you 
at the end of the game you will see you score and you have to follow the rules of answeres 
The game starts with easy questions and getting harder 
Googluck!


I run the game in Heroku 
It should be working from the html link  without  asking to log in but just in case:
